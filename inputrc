# This lets you use up and down to search your bash history.
# For example, typing "v<up>" will show you the last command
# you ran starting with "v", and pressing Enter will run that
# command again.  Note that you should configure unlimited
# bash history to use this effectively.  This is a classic
# trick; I'm not sure exactly where it originated, but see
